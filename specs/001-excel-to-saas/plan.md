# Implementation Plan: Excel to SaaS Migration

**Branch**: `001-excel-to-saas` | **Date**: 2025-01-21 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-excel-to-saas/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Migrate Excel-based project management system (REF.02.387.xlsm) to a full-stack web application. The system tracks projects through multiple phases (Studies, Design), manages team assignments and allocations, tracks costs and KPIs, generates reports, and provides dashboard views. Technical approach involves API-first design, TDD, Excel data import with validation, and compliance with constitution principles for data integrity, security, and observability.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Node.js 20+ (Backend), React 18+ (Frontend), TypeScript for both
**Primary Dependencies**:
  - Backend: Express.js, Prisma 5+, Auth0, SheetJS (xlsx), ExcelJS, PDFKit, Winston, Redis, Supertest
  - Frontend: React 18+, Vite, Zustand, Material-UI v5+, Axios, React Router, Jest, Playwright
  - Auth: OAuth 2.0/OIDC via Auth0
**Storage**: PostgreSQL 16+ (Primary DB), Redis 7+ (Caching), AWS S3 (Object Storage)
**Testing**: Jest (Backend/Unit), Supertest (API Integration), Playwright (E2E)
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge), Linux server (Backend)
**Project Type**: web
**Performance Goals**: Dashboard load <2s for 1000 projects, 100 concurrent users, report export <10s, cost reports <5s for 50 team members
**Constraints**: Data accuracy 100% for migration, 90% success rate on first attempt, support for real-time updates, concurrent edit handling
**Scale/Scope**: 1000 projects, 100 concurrent users, multiple project phases, team allocation tracking, cost tracking, KPI tracking, report generation

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### I. API-First Design
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT
- **Plan**: All features will be designed through API layer first with OpenAPI documentation. Frontend will develop against API contracts independently.
- **Design Verification**: OpenAPI 3.0 specification generated with 40+ endpoints. API contracts defined in `contracts/openapi.json`. RESTful design with `/api/v1/` versioning.
- **Gate**: ✅ Pass

### II. Data Integrity & Migration Accuracy
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT
- **Plan**: Excel migration will include validation checks comparing source Excel output with SaaS output. All business logic from Excel will be extracted and implemented as explicit service-layer logic. Migration scripts will be auditable and reversible.
- **Design Verification**: Data model includes audit logging (AuditLog entity). Migration strategy documented with validation checks in `research.md`. Transactional bulk loading with rollback on failure planned.
- **Gate**: ✅ Pass

### III. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT
- **Plan**: TDD will be strictly enforced. Tests will be written BEFORE implementation. Integration tests will validate Excel-to-SaaS data transformations with real Excel file inputs.
- **Design Verification**: Testing frameworks selected: Jest (unit), Supertest (integration), Playwright (E2E). Quality gates include 80%+ code coverage. Constitution requires TDD as NON-NEGOTIABLE.
- **Gate**: ✅ Pass

### IV. Integration Testing
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT
- **Plan**: Integration tests for all API endpoints, database migrations, authentication flows, Excel data import/export, and multi-step user journeys. Performance tests will validate response time requirements at scale.
- **Design Verification**: All API contracts include integration test coverage. Supertest for API testing. Performance tests for dashboard load (<2s for 1000 projects), report export (<10s), cost reports (<5s).
- **Gate**: ✅ Pass

### V. Security & Compliance
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT
- **Plan**: OAuth 2.0/OIDC authentication with RBAC, TLS 1.3+ encryption, audit logs for all changes, input validation and sanitization, secure data handling for sensitive Excel data.
- **Design Verification**: Auth0 selected for OAuth 2.0/OIDC. Three roles defined: MANAGER, TEAM_LEADER, TEAM_MEMBER. AuditLog entity tracks all changes. Row-level security planned for user permissions. Sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit.
- **Gate**: ✅ Pass

### VI. Observability & Maintainability
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT
- **Plan**: Structured logs with correlation IDs, metrics for API response times and error rates, health check endpoints, database migration scripts, automated testing.
- **Design Verification**: Winston selected for structured logging. Prometheus for metrics. Jaeger for distributed tracing. Prisma migrations for schema versioning. Health check endpoints planned.
- **Gate**: ✅ Pass

### VII. User Experience Excellence
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT
- **Plan**: Responsive design with WCAG 2.1 AA, load times <3s for critical paths, clear error messages, intuitive project workflows, Excel-to-web workflow translations.
- **Design Verification**: Material-UI v5+ selected (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant). Performance targets defined: dashboard <2s, project creation <3min. Excel-to-web workflow translations documented in `quickstart.md`.
- **Gate**: ✅ Pass

### Technology Stack Standards
- **Frontend**: ✅ React 18+ with TypeScript, Vite, Zustand, Material-UI v5+ (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant)
- **Backend**: ✅ Node.js 20+ with Express.js and TypeScript, RESTful API with `/api/v1/` versioning, Prisma ORM, async processing for long-running tasks
- **Data Storage**: ✅ PostgreSQL 16+ (relational, ACID compliant), Redis 7+ (caching), AWS S3 (object storage), automated backups, transactional Excel data import with rollback

### Development Workflow
- **Code Review**: Peer review required, constitution compliance verified, tests reviewed, security implications checked
- **Quality Gates**: Unit tests pass (Jest), integration tests pass (Supertest), code coverage 80%+, linting passes (ESLint, Prettier), security scans conducted, performance tests pass
- **Deployment**: CI/CD pipeline with automated stages, staging environment, blue-green deployment, rollback procedures tested, backward-compatible migrations

**Overall Gate Status**: ✅ PASS - Design is constitution-compliant

**Structure Decision**: Web application with separate frontend and backend (Option 2). This separation enables:
- Independent scaling of frontend and backend
- API-first development as required by constitution
- Parallel development of frontend and backend teams
- Clear separation of concerns
- Frontend can develop against API contracts
